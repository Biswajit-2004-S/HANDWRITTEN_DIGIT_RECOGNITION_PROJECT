# HANDWRITTEN_DIGIT_RECOGNITION_PROJECT
This project focuses on building a deep learning model that can accurately recognize handwritten digits (0â€“9) from images. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture built with TensorFlow and Keras, trained on the widely-used MNIST dataset.

## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to develop a system that can take an image of a handwritten digit and correctly predict the number it represents. This kind of digit recognition is commonly used in applications like postal address reading, cheque scanning, and digit-based document processing.

## Key Features
Trained on the MNIST dataset (60,000 training and 10,000 test images)

Built using CNN architecture for high accuracy in image-based classification

Implemented using TensorFlow and Keras libraries

Capable of recognizing digits from 0 to 9 with strong generalization

## Tech Stack
Python

TensorFlow

Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib (for visualization)
